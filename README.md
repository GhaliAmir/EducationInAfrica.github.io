## Introduction

The African continent is made of young developing countries and is full of unexploited resources and unexplored richness. This thus provides a ground for development and growth. In an absence of financial resources and historical power, education can be the best tool for a socio-economical revolution, especially when we consider that this continent has a demographically young population.

1.**Educational Indicators**

-SE.PRM.ENRR.NUM.TO : Total enrollment in primary schools.
-SE.SEC.ENRR.NUM.TO : Total enrollment in secondary schools.
-SE.YRS.SCHL.FE     : School life expectancy (Female)
-SE.YRS.SCHL.MA     : School life expectancy (Male)
-SE.PRM.ENRL.TC.ZS  : Pupil-teacher ratio (Primary Schools)

## Success Stories

#### ETHIOPIA

Ethiopia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. In 2000, its GDP per capita was less than 150 USD/capita. It exceeds 350 USD/capita in 2019. Ethiopia invested heavily in education in the last two decades; more than 30% of its budget in 2012 was invested towards building schools and improving its people's education levels. This endeavour was immediately followed by an incredible increase in economic development indicators. Once they have ensured a secure education system and enough access to education for its people, Ethiopian governments were able to refocus their expenses towards securing other objectives, which is explained by the drop in the percentage of budget directed to education after 2013.

#### RWANDA

Rwanda, a country in central Africa, received its independence from Belgium in 1962. Since then, its history was troubled with internal conflicts between its different ethnic groups, mainly between the Hutu and the Tutsi. These tensions resulted in a civil war between 1990 and 1993 that took the lives of 60'000 people. A year later, in 1994, Rwandan leaders, mainly Hutu, commited one of the biggest human atrocities in the last decade of the 20th century; the Rwandan genocide. The UNO estimates that the lives of 800'000 Rwandans were taken by the ravages, majoritarily from the Tutsi.

It took until after 2003 for Rwanda to adopt a constitution, representing its people's will and reach political stability. Since then, Rwanda attained considerable levels of economical development (more than 6% yearly growth), which granted it the reputation of being Africa's Singapore. This due to certain major political reforms: facilitating the creation of new businesses and women.

In fact, the genocide's victims were predominantly men, creating a huge gap between the country's male and female population. In consequence, women gained a much more important role in the Rwandan society: they have better access to education and can take leadership positions and contribute better to the economy.
