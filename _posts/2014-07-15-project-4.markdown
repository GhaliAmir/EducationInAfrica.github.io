description: To see the relevance of the investment in education in the variation of the Human Development Index , we decided to study two politically similar cases -i.e. dictatorship states- but had different strategies towards education. These two countries being Tunisia (TUN) and Equatorial guinea (GNQ). They had both suffered from a dictatorial regime during the period lasting from 1990 until 2010 . They both had high GDP per capita relatively to their African counterparts. In the year 2010 it was 3000 USD for Tunisia and 8000 USD for Equatorial Guinea . 
description_2: However during this period Tunisia invested 25% of its budget in education which allowed it to have stable primary enrollment rates ranging between 106% and 116%. Wheras for Equatorial guinea indicator kept decreasing from 150% to 80% due to a lack of investment in education by the government (5.2% in 1998 - from World Bank database).
description_3: This difference of strategies led Tunisia to have an increasing Human Development Index going from 0.56 to 0.72 while the Equatorial guinea index only changed from 0.53 to 0.58 in this 15-year period. Moreover, this slight increase is mainly due to the discovery of the oil in Equatorial guinea by an american company, which transformed GNQ to an oil-exporting country. However, poverty rates are still high despite the high income per capita.
